Advanced Bash-Scripting
=======================

This project is a study of Advanced Bash-Scripting methods using the reference:

An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html

The manual assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction... all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIX wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques.
